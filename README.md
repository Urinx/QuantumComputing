# QuantumComputing

Recently I’m interested in quantum computing, it’s a fantastic quantum world. We’re at the start of a new stage in the information revolution.

If quantum physics sounds challenging to you, you are not alone. All of our intuitions are based on day-to-day experiences and are defined by classical physics — so most of us find the concepts in quantum physics counterintuitive at first. In order to comprehend the quantum world, you must let go of your beliefs about our physical world, and develop an intuition for a completely different (and often surprising) set of laws.

Here I translate the quantum computing documentation from the IBM Q Experience1 to chinese, on the one hand it’s convenient for others to capture the tough concepts, on the other hand it also gives me a solid understanding.
